# About me

I am a biologist with interest in evolution ðŸ¦– and teaching evolution. During my PhD I was working on theoretical models describing fish growth under hormonal regulation, particularly the impact of predation and parasitism on juvenile growth. During the last years I have focused on teaching and tried to figure out how to make evolution understandable for learners of different ages - from students to children in primary school.
